pointer:-
     pointer is a variable that stores address.they are used to allocate new objects on heap.
     to pass functions to other functions,to iterate over elements in arrays or other data structures.

declarition:-
     int *ptr = null;
     int *ptr = &a;

     e.g. 1. int n = 10;
     	     int *ptr = &n;

	     cout<<n;----------> 5;
	     cout<<&n; --------> address of n
	     cout<<ptr --------> address of n
	     cout<<&ptr -------> address of ptr
	     cout<< *ptr ------> 5;  
	     
	     here * is the derefrence operator it prints the value stored at the address 
	     stored by pointer.

dynamic memory allocation:-
	in c++ using new keyword we can create variable in heap. when we create a variable 
	dynamically, address is returned of dynamically created vairiable. and in order to 
	track it or store it pointers are used.

	int *ptr = new int; ------> create int variabe in heap and store in pointer.
	*ptr = 5;     -----------> store data in variable pointed by pointer.

	delete ptr;  ------------> deallocate memory

dont use int arr[n];
	here arr[n] is considered as bad practice because n can exceed at any limit. thus 
	here array is crated in stack so limited amount of memeory is present but instade 
	we can create n ammoutn of interger memory in heap and then return its address 
	in static memory in stack.

	int *arr = new int[n];
